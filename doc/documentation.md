## Enforcer

An Enforcer Profile contains a configuration for a Enforcer. It contains various
parameters, like what network should not policeds, what processing units should
be ignored based on their tags and so on. It also contains more advanced
parameters to fine tune the Agent. A Enforcer will decide what profile to apply
using aEnforcer Profile Mapping Policy. This policy will decide according the
Enforcer's tags what profile to use. If an Enforcer tags are matching more than
a single policy, it will refuse to start. Some parameters will be applied
directly to a running agent, some will need to restart it.

## FileAccessPolicy

A File Access Policy allows Processing Units to access various folder and files.
It will use the tags of a File Path to know what is the path of the file or

When a Processing Unit is Docker container, then it will police the volumes
mount. executewon''t have any effect.

File path are not supported yet for standard Linux processes.

## Namespace

A Namespace represents the core organizational unit of the system. All objects
always exists in a single namespace. A Namespace can also have child namespaces.
They can be used to split the system into organizations, business units,
applications, services or any combination you like.

## NamespaceMappingPolicy

A Namespace Mapping Policy defines in which namespace a Processing Unit should
be placed when it is created, based on its tags.

When an Aporeto Agent creates a new Processing Unit, the system will place it in
its own namespace if no matching Namespace Mapping Policy can be found. If one
match is found, then the Processing will be bumped down to the namespace
declared in the policy. If it finds in that child namespace another matching
Namespace Mapping Policy, then the Processing Unit will be bumped down again,
until it reach a namespace with no matching policies.

This is very useful to dispatch processes and containers into a particular
namespace, based on a lot of factor.

You can put in place a quarantine namespace that will grab all Processing Units
with too much vulnerabilities for instances.

### Example

```json
{
  "mappedNamespace": "/blue/namespace",
  "name": "the name",
  "subject": [
    [
      "color=blue"
    ]
  ]

A Processing Unit reprents anything that can compute. It can be a Docker
container, or a simple Unix process. They are created, updated and deleted by
