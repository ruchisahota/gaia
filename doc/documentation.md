## FileAccessPolicy

A File Access Policy allows Processing Units to access various folder and files.
It will use the tags of a File Path to know what is the path of the file or
folder to allow access to. You can allow the Processing Unit to have any
combination of read, write or execute.

When a Processing Unit is Docker container, then it will police the volumes
mount. executewon''t have any effect.

File path are not supported yet for standard Linux processes.

## NamespaceMappingPolicy

A Namespace Mapping Policy defines in which namespace a Processing Unit should
be placed when it is created, based on its tags.  When an Aporeto Agent creates
a new Processing Unit, the system will place it in its own namespace if no
matching Namespace Mapping Policy can be found. If one match is found, then the
Processing will be bumped down to the namespace declared in the policy. If it
finds in that child namespace another matching Namespace Mapping Policy, then
the Processing Unit will be bumped down again, until it reach a namespace with
no matching policies.  This is very useful to dispatch processes and containers
into a particular namespace, based on a lot of factor.   You can put in place a
quarantine namespace that will grab all Processing Units with too much
vulnerabilities for instances.

### Example

```json
{
  "mappedNamespace": "/blue/namespace",

## ProcessingUnit

A Processing Unit reprents anything that can compute. It can be a Docker
container, or a simple Unix process. They are created, updated and deleted by
the system as they come and go. You can only modify its tags.  Processing Units
use Network Access Policies to define which other Processing Units or External
Services they can communicate with and File Access Policies to define what File
Paths they can use.

  "name": "the name",

listens for TLS. However, the application does not need to be modified and
the enforcer will map the traffic to the correct application port. This useful
when an application is being accessed from a public network.

## StatsQuery

StatsQuery is a generic API to retrieve time series data stored by the Aporeto
