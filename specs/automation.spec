# Attributes
attributes:
  v1:
  - name: actions
    description: Contains the code that will be executed if the condition is met.
    type: list
    exposed: true
    subtype: string
    stored: true

  - name: aporetoToken
    description: |-
      Contains the Segment token used by the automation's HTTP client. This token is
      derived from the automation's app credential attribute.
    type: string
    stored: true
    autogenerated: true
    encrypted: true

  - name: appCredential
    description: |-
      Contains the app credential associated with the automation which has its roles
      deduced from the automation's entitlements.
    type: string
    stored: true
    autogenerated: true
    encrypted: true

  - name: condition
    description: |-
      Condition contains the code that will be executed to decide if any action(s)
      should be executed. Providing a condition for an automation with a
      "Webhook" trigger type will have no impact as the condition will not be
      evaluated. If no condition is defined, then the automation action(s) will be
      executed; this behaves akin to a condition that always succeeds.
