  description: |-
    An SSH authorization allows you to define the permissions for the owner
    of a OpenSSH certificate issued by an Aporeto certificate authority. You can
    define if a user with some claims can connect to an `sshd` server managed by
    an instance of `enforcerd` according to its tags, what permissions he has and
    for how long delivered certificates are valid.

  - name: forceCommand
    description: |-
      Specify a single command that the user can issue on the remote host. This can be
      useful
      for issuing single-purpose certificates; ensuring that users stay in their home
      directories
      (`internal-sftp`); and restricting users to a bash shell (`/bin/bash`),
      preventing them
      from running arbitrary and unlogged commands such as `scp`, `rsync`, `-essh`,
      and `sftp`.
      Refer to the [FreeBSD
      documentation](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sshd_config(5))
      for more information.

    description: |-
      On systems without the Aporeto enforcer, you must provide the name of the Linux
      user.
      Otherwise, Aporeto will automatically populate this field and adding a value
      here is
      optional and not used during the authorization. However, the value becomes a tag
      associated with the SSH processing unit, which could be useful.

      provider,
      these tags correspond to claims in the ID token.
