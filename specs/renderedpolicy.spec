# Attributes
attributes:
  v1:
  - name: certificate
    description: |-
      The certificate associated with this processing unit. It will identify the
      processing unit to any internal or external services.
    type: string
    exposed: true
    read_only: true

  - name: datapathType
    description: |-
      The datapath type that this processing unit must implement according to
      the rendered policy:
      - `Default`: This policy is not making a decision for the datapath.
      - `Aporeto`: The defender is managing and handling the datapath.
      - `EnvoyAuthorizer`: The defender is serving Envoy-compatible gRPC APIs
      that for example can be used by an Envoy proxy to use the Segment PKI
      and implement Segment network policies. NOTE: The defender is not
      owning the datapath in this case. It is merely providing an authorizer API.
