  description: |-
    A processing unit represents anything that can compute. It can be a Docker
    container or a simple Unix process. Processing units are created, updated, and
    deleted by
    the system as they come and go. You can only modify their tags. Processing units
    use network policies to define which other processing units or external
    networks they can communicate with and file access policies to define what file
    paths they can use.

  - name: datapathType
    description: |-
      The datapath type that processing units are implementing:
      - `Aporeto`: The defender is managing and handling the datapath.
      - `EnvoyAuthorizer`: The defender is serving Envoy-compatible gRPC APIs
      that for example can be used by an Envoy proxy to use the Segment PKI
      and implement Segment network policies. NOTE: The defender is not
      owning the datapath in this case. It is merely providing an authorizer API.
